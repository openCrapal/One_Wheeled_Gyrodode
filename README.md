# One_Wheeled_Gyropode

Afer a few accidents with my previous gyropode prototype, I decided to improve my hardware.
Then it hit me: why not improving it drasticaly? I found some inspiration in the fantasy-world of Borderlands: https://www.2k.com/games/borderlands-2, and the one-wheeled robot they imagined, I want to make it real.

I've search a little on the internet (stand 27/01/2017), and I haven't found any similar project. They are some great devices able to stand on one foot using inertia wheels to correct their tilt, but nothing based only on the movement of the unique wheel.

I have some more work to do to bring the robot to live, I'll try to keep tracks.
